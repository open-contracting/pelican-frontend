Technical overview
==================

The Django project is made up of three apps:

-  ``dqt``: Serves API requests for the :doc:`../../frontend/index`
-  ``exporter``: Generates the exports to Google Docs
-  ``processor``: Serves API requests for managing Pelican backend

To view the processor API's documentation, run the server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/.
