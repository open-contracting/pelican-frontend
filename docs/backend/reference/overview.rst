Technical overview
==================

The Django project is made up of three apps:

-  ``api``: Serves API requests for the :doc:`../../frontend/index` and  for managing datasets in Pelican backend
-  ``exporter``: Generates the exports to Google Docs

To view the API's documentation, run the server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger-ui/.
