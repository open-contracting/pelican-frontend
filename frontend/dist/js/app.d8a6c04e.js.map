There are five types of checks:</p><ul><li><p><b>Distribution</b>: The distribution of a field's values suggests no omissions or inaccuracies. <i>Examples</i>: If all <code>procurementMethod</code> fields have a value of 'open', then the collection either omits or misreports non-open methods; if all <code>tender.status</code> fields have a value of 'active', then the collection either omits or misreports non-active statuses.</p></li><li><p><b>Repetition</b>: The repetition of a field's values suggests no data entry or mapping issues. <i>Examples</i>: If the contract value is zero 10% of the time, there might be a data mapping issue; if the award value is $25,000 10% of the time, there might be a data entry issue.</p></li><li><p><b>Uniqueness</b>: A field's values are unique across the collection.</p></li><li><p><b>Availability</b>: A random sample of URL values return no responses with HTTP error codes.</p></li><li><p><b>Related processes</b>: A related process reference field has a valid target within the collection, and its <code>title</code> is consistent with the target's <code>tender.title</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Some checks report distributions, but don't pass or fail; for example, the distribution of document types has no pass-fail criterion.</p><p>Some of these checks might, in principle, serve as red flags. The difference is that red flags are more sensitive. These checks have higher thresholds for failure; i.e. the data needs to be not only suspect (mild outliers) but <i>bad</i> (extreme outlier).</p>\",\n        subheadline: \"All Collection-Level Checks\",\n        label_0_1: \"top 1%\",\n        label_1_5: \"top 1-5%\",\n        label_5_20: \"top 5-20%\",\n        label_20_50: \"top 20-50%\",\n        label_50_100: \"last 50%\",\n        label_1: \"1\",\n        label_2_20: \"2 - 20\",\n        label_21_50: \"21 - 50\",\n        label_51_100: \"51 - 100\",\n        label_100: \"100+\",\n        examples: \"Examples\",\n        from: \"from\",\n        insufficientShown: \"Hide not calculated checks\",\n        insufficientHidden: \"Show not calculated checks\",\n        sections: {\n            status_distribution: \"Status distribution\",\n            value_distribution: \"Value distribution\",\n            other_distribution: \"Other distribution\",\n            repetition: \"Repetition\",\n            other: \"Other\"\n        },\n        distribution: {\n            tender_status: {\n                name: \"Tender status distribution\",\n                description: \"Visualizes the distribution of <code>tender.status</code> values.
